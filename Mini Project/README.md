# Introduction

This is a three member group mini-project for the Computer Programming II course, focusing on recursion and generics in Java. The primary objective is to develop a program capable of obtaining a specific value or the closest possible value through a combination of given input values. The program supports various data types, including integers, characters, and user-defined data types.

## Project Instructions:

For the mini-project, students will form project groups (3-5 students team). You will submit the project (only one
student in the team will submit it). Put a readme.txt file in your zip file so that I can see group members and any
messages you want to deliver about your project submission. In zip file there will be only .java files and readme.txt
file.I will examine it then I may ask you to present it to me. If there is a presentation, then I will ask questions to
you so it is not guaranteed that all project members will take the same grades from the project.

You may use only the techniques and libraries we covered in the course.

In this mini project, you will try to obtain a Value (or closest Value) for given Values. Note that this value can be
any kind of object, i.e. numbers. Operators are addition, subtraction, and multiplication and their behavior on
values is defined by you. As you can see in this problem order of operator is not important since parenthesis are
used.

For example, if the values are in number type and input numbers are 11, 7, 12, 6 and output number is 41 then you
should output
```
(((12 - 7) * 6) + 11) = 41
```
since
```
(((12 - 7) * 6) + 11) > ((5 * 6) + 11) > (30 + 11) > 41
```
Please also note that, you do not need to use all values to reach output value.

As another example, your inputs are characters (single or multiple) such as `R, A, N, A` and desired output is `NAR`
then you should output
```
(((N + R) * A) - A) > ((NR * A) - A) > (NARA - A) > NAR
```
As you see you also need to change the behavior of addition, subtraction, and multiplication for letters. Distance
between the obtained word (NAR) and target word (NAR) is zero so you did it. But distance between NAR and NBR
is -1 (see the shared distance function for finding the distances between 2 strings).

So here, + concatenates characters/strings, * puts the second one after each letter of the first one, and - removes
the character from the first one.
```
Example 1: KABA - C > KABA (C is not found)
Example 2: KABA - B > KAA
Example 3: KABA - A > KAB
```
- operators are fixed: addition, subtraction, multiplication

- output is single but input variables can be in any number. so there can be 3 inputs, or 5, or 30. so your
implementation should able to get any number of input. you do not need to get input and output data from console.
just create them in main method as your test cases, then I can change these lines of code to test my own inputs. I
urge you to use recursion in this mini project.

- input variable can be any type. it can be integer, it can be character, it can be double, or it can be an enumeration
that you defined yourself. For example: Enum Animals {Cat, Dog, Cow, Snake};

so your input type must be an abstract class and you should derive your input data type classes from that.

- addition, subtraction, multiplication behavior should be abstract and you should define your sub classes such that
you will addition, subtraction, multiplication for integer, and you should have another addition, subtraction,
multiplication for letters etc. for example Cat + Dog can be Cow if you defined addition in that behavior.

Use is-a and has-a mechanisms, inheritance, interfaces, aggregation, composition, polymorphism, constructors
etc. and create a good and flexible (and extendable) software.
